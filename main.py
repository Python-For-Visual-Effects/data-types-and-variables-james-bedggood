"""Python for Visual Effects.

Assignment #1 - Data Types and Variables

Answer the following questions.
"""

# 1.- Make a program that solves and shows the summation of 64 + 32

print(64+32)

# 2.- Do the same as the question one but this time use variables instead of 
# numbers.

x = 64
y = 32
print(x + y)

# 3.- Make a program that prints a sentence that includes at least 3 variables.

first_name = "James"
last_name = " Bedggood"
_greeting = "Hello, my name is "
print(_greeting + first_name + last_name)

# 4.- Given a sentence, assign the string to a variable then print the number of 
# characters in the sentence. 
# The sentence is "This is my first Python program."

test_sentence = "This is my first Python program."
len(test_sentence)

# 5.- Given the resolution 1920 x 1080, make a program that prints a string with 
# the 10% over-scan value of those numbers. The printed string must be as 
# follows: "The 10% overscan of 1920 is <value 1>, and the 1080 is <value 2>"

first_number = 1920
second_number = 1080
ten_percent = 1.1
result_one = first_number*ten_percent
result_two = second_number*ten_percent
print("The 10% overscan result of")
first_name
print("is")
result_one
print("and the")
second_number
print("is")
result_two
